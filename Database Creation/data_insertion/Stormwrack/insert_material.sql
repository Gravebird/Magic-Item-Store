    (7,3,"Pearlsteel","<p>A strange metal crafted by secretive aventi metalurgists working near volcanic vents in the ocean floor, pearlsteel is gleaming, shining steel covered with a blue-white sheen like mother of pearl. Created from fine steel and rare silvery pearls found only in the ocean depths where the pressure alone would kill a land walker, pearlsteel is highly prized by all undersea races and constitutes a major trade item for the aventi.</p><p>Pearlsteel is very light, especially in water. Pearlsteel items weigh 25% less than their normal equivalents.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Item</strong></th><th><strong>Market Price Modifier</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Light armor</td><td>+500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Medium armor</td><td>+1,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy armor</td><td>+1,500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>+500 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Weapon</td><td>+1,500 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Pearlsteel also slices more smoothly through the resistance that water presents. When a slashing weapon made of pearlsteel is used in the water, its damage is reduced by -1 rather than the normal -2 for fighting in the water with a slashing weapon, and its damage s reduced by -2 instead of half. Likewise, damage dealt underwater by a bludgeoning weapon made of pearlsteel is reduced by -2 rather than reduced by half. The market price modifier for such a weapon is +1,500 gp.</p>"),
    (8,3,"Riverine","<p>This unusual material is made from water under extremely high pressure, usually obtained from the Elemental Plane of Water but sometimes from the blackwater trenches far below the ocean's surface. The water swirls and flows continuously, sandwiched between fields of magical force.</p><p>Hald of the Armor Class bonus from armor and shields made from riverine is a deflection bonus (round down). For example, a suit of riverine chainmail would provide a +2 armor bonus and a +3 deflection bonus to AC. This substance is considered masterwork and can be enhanced magically as any other armor.</p><p>Riverine is sometimes also used to create walls and even containers. Being enclosed in magical force, it is immune to all damage and is unaffected by most spells. However, <em>disintigrate</em> immediately destroys an item made of riverine, as does a <em>rod of cancellation</em>, a <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, or a <em>disjunction</em> spell, causing the water to spill out in a sudden rush. Armor and shields made of riverine do not form a complete enclosure, so breath weapons and spells do still affect the water. However, walls of riverine block etherial travel, breath weapons, and spell effects, just as a <em>wall of force</em> does.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Type of Riverine Item</strong></th><th><strong>Item Cost Modifier</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Light armor</td><td>+9,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Medium armor</td><td>+16,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy armor</td><td>+25,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>+4,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Other items</td><td>+2,000 gp/lb.</td></tr></tbody></table>");
