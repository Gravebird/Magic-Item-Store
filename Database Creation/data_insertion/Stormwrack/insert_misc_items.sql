    "<p>This is an emergency flotation device for those who find themselves cast overboard. It can also be used to support a nonswimmer being assisted through water. A float bladder is a sack of oiled hide that can be filled with air. It has a long neck that is knotted shut after filling and ropes or straps to fasten to the wearer. A float bladder can keep afloat one Medium creature. Treat this as a leather object (hardness 2); if it takes 5 or more points of damage, the skin is punctured.

A punctured or deflated float bladder is a burden to a swimmer, imposing a -2 penalty on Swim checks if it is not removed.</p>"),

    "<p>A sextant is a sophisticated device used to determine a vessel's position by measuring the angle formed by the sun or stars and the horizon. It uses mirrors and carefully graduated scales to sight a heavenly body, whose position is compared to a listing in an almanac for the day and year of measurement.

    (133,3,"Air Plant","Special Substances and Items",25.00,0.00,
    "<p>The air plant is a bizarre form of pond vegetation whose spongy structure produces and stores air, keeping the plant at the surface so it can receive adequate light. This mass remains alive and continues to produce air even after being cut from the plant, provided it is kept moist and well-lit. When placed in the mouth, a fist-sized piece of this material can provide enough air to sustain a Medium air-breathing creature for 5 minutes. After that time, the submerged creature must begin holding its breath and risks drowning. The air plant dies after use and can't be recharged - another portion must be procured.</p>"),

Each living creature within the smoke must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened as long as it remains and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. Each round a creature remains within the smoke, it must make another save.</p><p>The pot's contents are consumed in 3 rounds, and the vapors disperse naturally. Lighting a stinkpot is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>");
