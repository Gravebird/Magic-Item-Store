    (36,3,"Acidic Burst",2,true,true,true,true,true,true,"<p>An acidic burst weapon functions as a corrosive weapon (see below) that also releases a burst of acid upon making a critical hit. The acid does not harm the wielder or the weapon. In addition to the extra acid damage from the corrosive special weapon ability, an acidic burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of acid damage instead; if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points of acid damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the acid energy upon their ammunition. Even if the corrosive ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra acid damage on a critical hit.</p>"),
    (37,3,"Aquatic",1,true,true,true,true,true,true,"<p>Weapons with this enhancement have a silvery-blue tinge, similar in sheen to the scales of certain fish. The wielder is treated as though he were under the effects of a <em>freedom of movement</em> spell for the purpose of using this weapon while underwater; it negates the penalties that would otherwise apply from using the weapon underwater.</p>"),
    (38,3,"Corrosive",1,true,true,true,true,true,true,"<p>Upon command, a corrosive weapon becomes slick with a thick layer of acidic slime. The acid does not harm the wielder and does not wash away in water. The effect remains until a counter command is given. A corrosive weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage per hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the acid energy upon their ammunition.</p>");
