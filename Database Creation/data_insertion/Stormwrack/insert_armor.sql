    "<p>Similar to leather armor in appearance, sharkskin is treated so that the sharp, toothlike scales covering the skin remain attached to the outside of the armor. Additionally, shark teeth are embedded along the forearms, shoulders, and legs, which counts as armor spikes. Sharksin armor provides a +6 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks made when the wearer is bound with rope or similar easily cut bindings.</p>"),

    "<p>This armor is created from specially treated totoise or monstrous crab shells. The armormaking process softens the shells, making them far more pliable and likely to bend instead of shatter when struck. Shell armor includes a breastplate, shoulder guards, and even gauntlets created from smaller and smaller shells. The main difference between shell and chitin armor is the degree of coverage; shell armor usually leaves the legs bare.</p>"),

    "<p>Chitin armor is contructed from the shells of giant vermin or similar creatures. For aquatic raves, monstrous crabs are the most popular source for chitin armor. The chitin is treated for flexibility and often cut and reshaped in long strips bound together by tightly woven cord where necessary.</p>"),
    
    (3, "Living Coral", "Medium", 16000.00, 6,3,-4,20,20,15,30.00,"Uncommon",
    "<p>Coral armor is heavy and difficult to craft (see page 15 of the <em>Arms and Equipment Guide</em>). An expensive alternative is growing a casing of living coral over the wearer. The user wears a medallion crafted from a piece of living reef, from which coral grows to envelop the body. The living coral is tough, but not as stony and inflexible as that of an established reef, allowing relatively free movement. It dies at sundown and regrows again at sunup; this process takes about 2 hours. Dark conditions also cause the coral to die, while extended light keeps it alive.</p><p>For an additional 500 gp, the following special ability can be crafted onto the coral.</p><p><em>Stinging Polyps:</em> The coral polyps' natural ability to sting prey is enhanced. Once per day, if you get a hold while grappling, the opponent must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.</p>");
