        "<p>This rod acts as magnet, drawing spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character possessing the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.</p><p>A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. For example, a rod that absorbs a 6th-level spell and a 3rd-level spell has a total of nine absorbed spell levels. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. Continuing the example above, the rod wielder could use the nine absorbed spell levels to cast one 9th-level spell, or one 5th-level spell and one 4th-level spell, or nine 1st-level spells, and so on. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of appropriate level or levels that they know.</p><p>A <em>rod of absorption</em> absorbs a maximum of fifty spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.</p><p>A more specific example: Jozan the cleric uses a brand-new <em>rod of absorption</em> to nullify the effect of a <em>suggestion</em> spell cast at him by a sorceror. The rod has now absorbed three spell levels and can absorb forty-seven more. Jozan can cast any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell he has prepared, without loss of that preparation, by using the stored potential of the rod. Let's assume he casts <em>hold person</em> back at the sorceror who just attacked him. This spell is 2nd level for him, so the rod still holds one spell level of potential, can absorb forty-seven more, and has disposed of two spell levels permanently.</p><p>To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: On a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within. For example, if the first roll determines that the rod has thirty-four levels of absorption potential remaining, that means the rod has absorbed sixteen levels' worth of spells. Half of sixteen is 8, so there's a 30% chance that it still holds eight absorbed spell levels ready for use.</p>",
