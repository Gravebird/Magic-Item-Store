    weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it 
    because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property

    drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. In all other respects, it is considered wielded or attended by the 
    creature for all maneuvers and effects that target items (such as the sunder action or the heat metal spell). While dancing, it takes up the same space as the activating character and can attack adjacent foes 
    (weapons with reach can attack opponents up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the person who activated it everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who loosed 
    it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its own as a free action; when so retrieved the weapon can't dance (attack on its own) again for 4 rounds."),

    the creature's next turn (and is therefore ready to use again that turn). Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If the character can't catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing 
    it, the weapon drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown."),

    the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception 
    to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting the spell normally.) Inflict serious wounds, contagion, blindness, and hold person are all common choices for the stored 
    spell. Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored 
    within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50% chance to have a spell stored in it already."),

    severs the opponent's head (if it has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not 
    affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die when their heads are cut off. The DM may have to make judgement calls about this sword's effect. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing
