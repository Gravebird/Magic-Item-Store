    (77,4,"Atlatl","Martial","Ranged",10.00,"1d3","1d4","x3",50,"P",2.00,"Common","<p>An Atlatl is a cross between a thrown weapon and a projectile weapon. It uses a flat, thin board made of wood or antler, ranging from 1 to 3 feet long. One end is held in the hand while the butt of a light spear, 2 to 3 feet long, is placed in a groove at the other end. At the end of the groove is a raised spur or pin to hold the bottom of the spear in place. You hold the loaded spear and handle end of the atlatl in the same hand. With a sidearm or overhead throw, you propel the spear with a force far greater than that of a hand-thrown spear. An atlatl often has a carved stone weight attached to the board's underside, and many feature a thong of hide or cord to attach to the hand.</p>"),
    (78,4,"Atlatl Spear (1)","Martial","Ranged",1.00,null,null,null,null,null,2.00,"Common","<p>Ammunition for the Atlatl weapon - this spear can be loaded into the Atlatl and propelled much farther than a hand-thrown spear could be.</p>"),
    (79,4,"Collapsing Crescent Fan","Exotic","Light Melee",40.00,"1d4","1d6","19-20/x2",null,"S",2.00,"Uncommon","<p>Only a few desert societies have the werewithal to forge the exotic weapon known as the collapsing crescent fan. Of those, the bhukas are most commonly associated with the weapon, and so another name for this weapon is the 'bhuka blade.'</p><p>When not in use, a crescent blade folds into a compact shape not too much larger than a wand. However, with a mere flick of the wrist, the many segments of a crescent blade slide into view and lock into place. The vanes of the fan are thin, razor-sharp steel sheets. When you attack a flat-footed foe with it, you gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll.</p>"),
    (80,4,"Eagle's Claw","Exotic","Light Melee",20.00,"1d4","1d6","18-20/x2",null,"S and P",2.00,"Uncommon","<p>The asheratis invented the first eagle's claw. This light, exotic melee weapon has a quarter-circle blade that is equally sharp on both the inner and outer edges. The blade is about 6 inches long and looks very much like an eagle's claw enlarged and forged in steel. The handle of an eagle's claw is slightly curved with a hole at the end to facilitate the use of a finger (middle or index) in wielding the weapon, allowing you to instantly swing the blade between differing grips. You get a +1 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal an eagle's claw on your body (see the Sleight of Hand skill, page 81 of the <em>Player's Handbook</em>).</p>"),
    (81,4,"Fingerblade","Exotic","Light Melee",45.00,"1d4","1d6","x3",null,"P",2.00,"Uncommon","<p>In its most basic definition, a fingerblade is a double-edged short sword. However, this weapon is customized to your hand. The hilt is something like a hand crossbow grip. It fits snugly in the palm of your hand such that your attack motion with the weapon is akin to a punch. Held correctly, a fingerblade becomes an extension of your forefinger, allowing maximized control. When an attack is properly executed, the hilt pushes into the palm so that no slippage occurs and maximum force is transferred into the thrust. If you are proficient with a fingerblade, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to a foe who is flat-footed on the first round of combat. Creatures with immunity to extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks are not subject to this extra damage.</p>"),
    (82,4,"Manople","Exotic","Light Melee",35.00,"1d4","1d6","19-20/x2",null,"S or P",1.00,"Uncommon","<p>Resembling a sai with blades, a manople is actually a gauntlet worn over your hand. Since it is worn this way, however, you cannot carry anything else in that hand, nor can you use it to cast spells or use skills.</p><p>A manople gives you a +1 shield bonus to AC. Unlike with a spiked shield, you retain this bonus to AC even on a round in which you make an attack with the manople. If you lack the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, you do not retain the shield bonus to AC, as you would with a spiked shield. A manople has no armor check penalty and a 5% arcane spell failure change. Like a spiked shield, a manople can be enhanced as a weapon, as a shield, or both, but such enhancements must be paid for and applied seperately.</p><p>An opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of this weapon. The cost and weight given are for a single manople.</p>"),
    (83,4,"Scorpion Claws","Exotic","Light Melee",160.00,"1d4","1d6","x2",null,"S or P",6.00,"Uncommon","<p>Designed as grappling weapons, scorption claws are worn over the forearm. These metal weapons resemble scorpion pincers, and they open and close by means of an internal mechanical handle. Scorpion claws grant you a +4 bonus on grapple checks and can be used to deal slashing damage with a successful grapple check. The open claws can be used as a slashing weapon in melee combat, while the closed pincers can be used as a piercing weapon. The claws can be opened or closed as a free action. Since the claws strap onto the arm, you get a +4 bonus on opposed grapple checks to avoid being disarmed. Scorpion claws come in pairs; the cost and weight given is for two.</p>"),
    (84,4,"Great Scimitar","Exotic","One-Handed Melee",200.00,"1d6","1d8","18-20/x2",null,"S",8.00,"Uncommon","<p>A great scimitar is too large to use in one hand without special training (the appropriate Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat). You can use a great scimitar two-handed as a martial weapon. Great Scimitars are most often the personal weapons of heroes, crafted as masterwork weapons and inscribed with the hero's deeds and the weapon's name on the blade. Such names commemorate a great event in the hero's life, such as 'The Blade of the Hundred-Day Sandstorm.'</p>"),

    (86,4,"Scorpion-tail Whip","Exotic","One-Handed Melee",75.00,"1d3","1d4","x2 (plus poison)",null,"S or P",3.00,"Uncommon","<p>A scorpion-tail whip is made from the dried tail of a Large monstrous scorpion, with the stinger intact. Used by some of the crueler desert tribes, the whip deals nonlethal damage except on a critical hit. On a critical hit, the whip deals lethal damage and injects a small amount of Large monstrous scorpion vecom (injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str), which is stored in a small bladder in the stinger. The bladder can hold only one dose at a time, and adding a dose of venom takes 1 minute. The whip can hold any other contact or injury poisons (see page 297 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> for details on other poisons).</p>"),
    (87,4,"Thrombash","Exotic","One-Handed Melee",15.00,"1d4","1d6","x3",10,"P or S",3.00,"Uncommon","<p>This fearsome weapon features two wicked, hooked blades facing in opposite directions at the end, and third blade jutting at an angle near the hilt. A thrombash is an exotic ranged weapon; it can be up to 30 inches long and is awkward to throw without special training. A character can use a thrombash in melee as a martial weapon.</p>"),
    (88,4,"Battlehorn","Exotic","Two-Handed Melee",50.00,"1d6/1d6","1d8/1d8","x3",null,"P",10.00,"Uncommon","<p>A battlehorn is a double weapon that consists of two large horns affixed together, facing in opposite directions. You can fight with it as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page 160 of the <em>Player's Handbook</em>). A creature wielding a battlehorn in one hand can't use it as a double weapon - only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round. If you use a ready action to set a battlehorn against a charge, you deal double damage if you score a hit against a charging character.</p>"),

The edge of the blade is perpendicular to the shaft, allowing you to whirl the weapon in deadly circles. When used in conjunction with the Whirlwind Attack feat, a crescent scythe deals an extra 1 point of damage.</p>"),

Because it is an executioner's weapon, it is often crafted as a masterwork weapon, marked with a royal seal, and created with one or more gems in the hilt.</p>"),
    (92,4,"Boomerang","Exotic","Ranged",10.00,"1d3","1d4","x2",20,"B",2.00,"Common","<p>This weapon is a lightweight throwing stick, flat and curved, that returns to you if it misses its target. It does not deal much damage, but it has good range, and being able to retrieve it is useful. Boomerangs are used mainly for hunting birds and other small creatures.</p>"),
