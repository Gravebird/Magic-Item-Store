<p>Each of the several kinds of <em>living figureheads</em> is carved from fine wood and resembles an ordinary figurehead. When a command word is spoken, the figurehead animates and is able to use special powers as described below. The <em>living figurehead</em> obeys and serves the ship's master (usually the captain). Unless stated otherwise, it can speak Common and communicate telepathically with its master, provided it is within 100 feet.</p><p>If a <em>living figurehead</em> is broken or destroyed in its carving form, it is forever ruined. If destroyed while animated, it simply reverts to a wooden carving that can be used again at a later time.</p><p>An animated <em>living figurehead</em> is a construct of the same size as the object (see Animated Object on page 12 of the <em>Monster Manual</em>), but it has the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores given in its entry. Special abilities whose save DCs depend on Constitution use the animated figurehead's Charisma score instead.</p><p><em>Dragon Head: </em>This Large dragon's head and neck are carved from cedar or spruce and painted as a chromatic or metallic dragon, with gaping mouth and fierce eyes.
