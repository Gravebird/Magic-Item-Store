        "<p>Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a <i>+2 light mace</i>. Its other magical powers are as follows.</p><ul><li><i>Thunder</i>: Once per day, the rod can strike as a <i>+3 light mace</i>, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li><li><i>Lightning</i>: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a <i>+2 light mace</i> (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li><li><i>Thunderclap</i>: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening, just as a <i>shout</i> spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).</li><li><i>Lightning Stroke</i>: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.</li><li><i>Thunder and Lightning</i>: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the <i>thunderclap</i> describes above with a lightning bolt, as in the <i>lightning stroke</i>. The <i>thunderclap</i> affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The <i>lightning stroke</i> deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the <i>thunderclap</i> deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.</li></ul>",
