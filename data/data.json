You can use a composite longbow while mounted.\n    Composite bows are made from laminated horn, wood, or bone and built with a recurve, meaning that the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.\n    All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).\n    If your Strength bonus is less than the Strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.\n    The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.\n    A composite longbow can be made with a high Strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.\n    Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. For instance, a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 200 gp, while a composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 500 gp.\n    For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus. With a regular composite longbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls. For 200 gp, he can buy a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.\n    For 300 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Strength bonus. Even if he had paid 400 gp for a composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.\n    The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light. \n    Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0). An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon's size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). \n    Items not primarily made of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be).

You can use a composite longbow while mounted.\n    Composite bows are made from laminated horn, wood, or bone and built with a recurve, meaning that the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.\n    All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).\n    If your Strength bonus is less than the Strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.\n    The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.\n    A composite longbow can be made with a high Strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.\n    Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. For instance, a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 200 gp, while a composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 500 gp.\n    For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus. With a regular composite longbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls. For 200 gp, he can buy a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.\n    For 300 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Strength bonus. Even if he had paid 400 gp for a composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.\n    The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow. Thus if you have Weapon Focus (longbow), that feat applies to both longbows and composite longbows.","Weapon_Quantity":1,"Weapon_Material":null,"Weapon_Properties":[{"Property_Name":"Enhancement +1","Property_Gold_Cost":null,"Property_Bonus_Value":1,"Property_Description":"This weapon is enchanted with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, as well as causing it to deal magic damage."},{"Property_Name":"Merciful","Property_Gold_Cost":null,"Property_Bonus_Value":1,"Property_Description":"This weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage it deals is nonlethal damage.

You can use a composite longbow while mounted.\n    Composite bows are made from laminated horn, wood, or bone and built with a recurve, meaning that the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.\n    All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).\n    If your Strength bonus is less than the Strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.\n    The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.\n    A composite shortbow can be made with a high Strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.\n    Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. For instance, a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 150 gp, while a composite shortbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 375 gp.\n    For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus. With a regular composite shortbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls. For 150 gp, he can buy a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.\n    For 225 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Strength bonus. Even if he had paid 300 gp for a composite shortbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.\n    The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.

You can use a composite longbow while mounted.\n    Composite bows are made from laminated horn, wood, or bone and built with a recurve, meaning that the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.\n    All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).\n    If your Strength bonus is less than the Strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.\n    The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.\n    A composite shortbow can be made with a high Strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.\n    Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. For instance, a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 150 gp, while a composite shortbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 375 gp.\n    For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus. With a regular composite shortbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls. For 150 gp, he can buy a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.\n    For 225 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Strength bonus. Even if he had paid 300 gp for a composite shortbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.\n    The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow. Thus if you have Weapon Focus (shortbow), that feat applies to both shortbow and composite shortbow.","Weapon_Quantity":2,"Weapon_Material":null,"Weapon_Properties":[{"Property_Name":"Enhancement +1","Property_Gold_Cost":null,"Property_Bonus_Value":1,"Property_Description":"This weapon is enchanted with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, as well as causing it to deal magic damage."},{"Property_Name":"Masterwork","Property_Gold_Cost":300,"Property_Bonus_Value":0,"Property_Description":"A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normalweapon.

You can use a composite longbow while mounted.\n    Composite bows are made from laminated horn, wood, or bone and built with a recurve, meaning that the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.\n    All composite bows are made with a particular Strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).\n    If your Strength bonus is less than the Strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.\n    The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.\n    A composite shortbow can be made with a high Strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.\n    Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. For instance, a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 150 gp, while a composite shortbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 375 gp.\n    For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus. With a regular composite shortbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls. For 150 gp, he can buy a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.\n    For 225 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Strength bonus. Even if he had paid 300 gp for a composite shortbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.\n    The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has. For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow. Thus if you have Weapon Focus (shortbow), that feat applies to both shortbow and composite shortbow.","Weapon_Quantity":1,"Weapon_Material":null,"Weapon_Properties":[{"Property_Name":"Enhancement +1","Property_Gold_Cost":null,"Property_Bonus_Value":1,"Property_Description":"This weapon is enchanted with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, as well as causing it to deal magic damage."},{"Property_Name":"Thundering","Property_Gold_Cost":null,"Property_Bonus_Value":1,"Property_Description":"A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder upon striking a successful critical hit.
