This project is intended to make random item shops in Dungeons and Dragons V3.5, which is a feature that my friends and I have been talking about for a very long time.

First, I will create a database and fill it with items from the D&D rulebooks, starting with the Dungeon Master's Guide.
The goal is to have the database filled with every item for version 3.5, but as a start I am just aiming for the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Once the first book is complete (all items added), I will then write a program that pulls items from the database matching criteria that the user can choose (see user stories).
Once it has this data, it will then randomly select items from the result and store the information into variables. Repeat this process until all criteria have been filled.
Finally, it will create a simple html page to display the results, with clickable item names to get more information.
